              Our team was tasked with designing and developing a new feature
              for an existing app. We analyzed the current user experience,
              identified improvement opportunities, and created a feature that
              would seamlessly integrate with the app.

            “Bloom Board” is a pin board where users can go on to leave notes
            daily and look or reply to others. It allows users to express
            themselves while spreading positivity and kindness with the
            community. They make connections by sharing experiences, optimistic
            mindsets or asking for advice through little notes also by leaving
            inspirational or relatable replies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instruction at the top encourages users to write positive things,
            there’s also an AI assistant to scan for bad words and negative

                Users find the game unappealing because it feels less useful
                than other activities and fails to help them relax or relieve
                stress. Some users find it hard to find the tasks they have to
                do and would feel frustrated, discouraging them from continuing.
                Many also feel guilty about spending time on games or

          <h3>what I have learned?</h3>
          <p>
            I learned that understanding the audience is the most important step
            before diving into development. It’s essential to ensure the feature
            meets their needs. One thing I hadn't initially considered was the
            level of simplicity and clarity needed for a seamless user
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another key takeaway from this project is that balancing user needs
            with business goals is just as important as understanding the
            audience. Defining the problem clearly and sticking to it acts like
            a navigation system—it keeps our ideas focused, prevents us from
            getting lost in the design process, and helps us brainstorm more
            efficiently.
